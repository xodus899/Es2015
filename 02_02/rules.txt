<!--  rules
 - Javascript is case sensitive
 - camelCase is used for Javascript ex: getElementByTagName
 	 - variables start lowercase
 	 - objects and classes start uppercase letter
 	 - constants are all caps
 - Javascript does not care about whitespace. But matters to humans
 - End each statement with a Semicolon. Not always required but good practice
 - Use comments Liberally  // single line  or /* multi line */
